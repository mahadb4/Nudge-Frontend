# API contract

Schema authority: nudge_schema_v3_1.sql (50 tables). Codes are from nudge_db_design_v3_1.md.
Phase tag on every endpoint: [midterm] or [later]. Midterm = sign-up, login, profile, database connectivity, CRUD for stages, companies, contacts, deals, audit log, API docs.
Your answers to QUESTIONS.md (2 Nov 2026) are applied. (Q-n) tags show which answer a rule comes from.
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md is the authority for layering, error codes, pagination shapes and rate limiting. Where this file and ARCHITECTURE.md disagree, ARCHITECTURE.md wins.
Q-23: Python 3.13.9. Q-28: rules cross-checked against docs/nudge_validation_spec_v3_1.md; differences are listed in BACKEND_PLAN section 6 and GAP_REPORT section 3.
Length rule (Q-30): where the frontend limit is stricter than the column, the frontend limit is enforced and the column is only the ceiling.

Build order (9 Nov 2026): authentication and authorization first; see BACKEND_PLAN section 3. Postponed until after the midterm, although specified here: cursor pagination and the full query parser, the token bucket and Redis (section 9; a simple fixed-window attempt limit is used instead, still answering 429 COMMON_RATE_LIMITED with Retry-After), GET/DELETE /auth/sessions/, GET /audit-logs/, and all /deals/ endpoints.

## 0. Conventions

Base and paths
- Prefix /api/v1/. Set VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1, so the paths the frontend already calls (/auth/login/ and so on) work unchanged.
- Trailing slash on every path, as the frontend uses.
- JSON only (except CSV export and import). UTF-8.

Field names
- snake_case on the wire. The client only accepts error keys that match /^[a-z_]{1,40}$/, so camelCase keys would be dropped.
- Where a frontend field maps to exactly one column, the frontend name is used: deal name (deals.title), contact title (contacts.job_title), company_id, contact_id (deals.primary_contact_id), lost_reason, owner_id.
- Where the frontend field is display text (close, created, last, sync, when, time), the column name is used instead: expected_close_date, created_at, last_contact_at, last_synced_at, updated_at.
- Contact names are first_name + last_name, plus read-only name (Q-14). The frontend form gets two fields.
- Smallint codes are sent as lowercase strings, mapped from the domain enums of each module. Example: visibility "private" | "team" | "organization" (1, 2, 3).
- Request bodies: Content-Type application/json only, at most 1 MB, unknown fields -> 400 COMMON_VALIDATION_FAILED. Client-computed fields (organization_id, role, version increments, created_at) are never read from the body (ARCHITECTURE 6).

Authentication
- Access token (JWT, 10 minutes, claims user_id, sid, jti) in the Authorization: Bearer header. It is held in memory by the frontend (setAccessToken).
- Refresh token in an httpOnly cookie nudge_refresh, Path=/api/v1/auth/. Only /auth/ endpoints read it.
- Endpoints that read or set the cookie require X-CSRFToken matching the csrftoken cookie.

Organization (Q-22)
- Header X-Organization-ID (uuid) selects the organization. If it is missing and the user has exactly one active membership, that one is used.
- Missing with several memberships: 400 TENANCY_ORGANIZATION_REQUIRED. Unknown, not a member, suspended or removed membership, or deactivated organization: 404 COMMON_NOT_FOUND.

Errors (ARCHITECTURE 4)
- Every error body is {"code": "AUTH_BAD_CREDENTIALS", "detail": "That email and password do not match."}.
  - The code is the NAME of a member of `class Messages(StrEnum)` in common/messages.py, in UPPER_SNAKE (area first: COMMON_, AUTH_, TENANCY_, VALIDATION_, CRM_, ...).
  - The detail is that member's English text, with any {} filled in.
  - The frontend decides behaviour from the code only, never from the text. A text can change freely; renaming a code is a breaking change.
- 400 validation adds the failing fields. The frontend client must read body.fields instead of the top-level keys (frontend change 22):
  {"code": "COMMON_VALIDATION_FAILED", "detail": "...", "fields": {"email": [{"code": "VALIDATION_EMAIL_INVALID", "detail": "..."}]}}
- 409 version conflicts add "current": <resource>. 429 responses add the Retry-After header.
- The full code list is `Messages` in common/messages.py; the auth-flow codes are listed in section 2. Codes named in this file for later modules (CRM_*, ACCOUNTS_*, WORKFLOW_*) are added to `Messages` when that module is built.

Errors that apply to every endpoint unless stated otherwise:
| Status | Code | When |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | COMMON_VALIDATION_FAILED, COMMON_MALFORMED_JSON, COMMON_INVALID_CONTENT_TYPE, COMMON_BODY_TOO_LARGE | Bad body, unknown field, bad query parameter |
| 401 | AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_INVALID | No access token, or it is malformed, expired or its session is revoked (not on public endpoints). The client refreshes once and retries |
| 403 | COMMON_FORBIDDEN | Role is not allowed (stated per endpoint) |
| 404 | COMMON_NOT_FOUND | Id does not exist, is soft-deleted, or belongs to another organization or user |
| 429 | COMMON_RATE_LIMITED | Token bucket empty; Retry-After, X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining headers |
| 500 | COMMON_SERVER_ERROR | Unexpected error; no stack trace or internal text |

Lists (ARCHITECTURE 7)
- Query parameters are parsed against a whitelist per resource (filters, sort, q, page or cursor, page_size). Anything else -> 400 COMMON_VALIDATION_FAILED with the parameter named in fields.
- Sort: ?sort=<field> or ?sort=-<field>, one field, from the resource's allowed list.
- q: cleaned, 2-100 characters; an empty q means no search.
- Offset lists (small: companies, contacts, members): ?page=1&page_size=25 (1-100) -> {"count", "next", "previous", "results"}.
- Cursor lists (large: audit log, deals per stage, later inbox): ?cursor=&page_size= -> {"results", "next_cursor"}.
  - The cursor is base64url of (sort value, id). The query uses WHERE (sort, id) < (x, y) LIMIT n + 1; next_cursor is null on the last page.
  - A malformed cursor -> 400 VALIDATION_CURSOR_INVALID.

Concurrency
- deals: body must carry version (deals.version). The update runs WHERE id = ? AND version = ?. 0 rows -> 409 COMMON_VERSION_CONFLICT with "current": <deal>.
- companies and contacts have no version column. The body carries updated_at as read; the update runs WHERE updated_at = ?. 0 rows -> 409 (Q-15).
- Delete is soft (deleted_at). Restore endpoints are later (Q-15).

Visibility (Q-20)
- New companies, contacts and deals default to visibility "organization" unless the request says otherwise.
- Manager is treated as Member.

Money and time
- amount: decimal string with 2 places, e.g. "18000.00". currency: ISO 4217. Totals are always lists per currency, [{"currency", "amount", "count"}], and are never added across currencies.
- Timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC. expected_close_date is YYYY-MM-DD. Time zones are IANA names.

Audit
- Every write below appends one audit_logs row: action 'object.verb', object_type, object_id, details {"label": <readable name at the time>, "changes": {...}}, ip_address. Listed per endpoint as "audit:".

## 1. common

### GET /health/ [midterm]
Public. Runs SELECT 1 and checks that the users table can be read.
200 {"status": "ok", "database": "ok"}. 503 {"code": "COMMON_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE", "detail": "..."}.
Tables: none (users, read-only probe).

### GET /schema/ and GET /docs/ [midterm]
OpenAPI 3 from drf-spectacular, and Swagger UI. Public when DEBUG is True; in production only for users with is_staff (Q-21).

## 2. accounts: auth

Auth-flow codes (texts are in common/messages.py):
| Code | Status | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| AUTH_CODE_SENT | 202 | register, resend (same body for known and unknown emails) |
| AUTH_RESET_LINK_SENT | 202 | reset (same body for known and unknown emails) |
| AUTH_BAD_CREDENTIALS | 401 | login |
| AUTH_EMAIL_UNVERIFIED | 403 | login |
| AUTH_INVALID_CODE | 400 | verify |
| AUTH_CODE_ATTEMPTS_EXCEEDED | 429 | verify |
| AUTH_INVALID_TOKEN | 400 | reset confirm |
| AUTH_WRONG_CURRENT_PASSWORD | 400 (in fields.current) | password change |
| AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_INVALID | 401 | every Bearer endpoint |
| AUTH_SESSION_INVALID | 401 | refresh (missing, expired, revoked or reused cookie; one code so reuse is not revealed) |
| AUTH_CSRF_FAILED | 403 | every cookie or CSRF-checked endpoint |
| COMMON_RATE_LIMITED | 429 | every bucket in section 9 |

### GET /auth/csrf/ [midterm] (built, A4)
Public. Sets the csrftoken cookie. 200 {"csrf_token": "..."}. Tables: none.

### POST /auth/register/ [midterm] (built, A4)
Public, CSRF required.
Request (same shape as the frontend sign-up form, src/pages/Auth.tsx, src/api/auth.ts, except type):
- business: {"name", "company", "email", "password", "type": "business", "timezone"}
- individual: {"name", "email", "password", "type": "individual", "timezone"}. The form sends company as undefined, so JSON.stringify drops the key.
- type is lowercase on the wire, like every other code. The frontend currently sends "Individual" / "Business" and must map them (frontend change 26). "Individual" or "Business" with capitals -> 400 VALIDATION_CHOICE_INVALID. GET /auth/me/ returns "individual" or "business" in "type".
- timezone: the frontend shows the browser zone but does not send it yet (frontend change 5). Until then a missing timezone is a 400, never a server default.
Response: 202 {"code": "AUTH_CODE_SENT", "detail": "..."} for every address. An existing address never gets new rows:
- never verified, and its code expired (more than 10 minutes): the latest sign-up wins. Password, name, timezone and the organization (name, type, timezone) are replaced in one transaction, the earlier code stops working and a new code is emailed (audit: user.register_replace).
- verified, or never verified but its code is still live: nothing changes and nothing is invalidated; that person is sent a "someone tried to register" email (audit: user.register_existing).
Writes, in one transaction:
- users: email (lowercased), password (Argon2 hash), full_name, timezone, is_active true.
- organizations:
  - account_type 1 Individual or 2 Business, from type;
  - name = the cleaned company (Business) or the user's own cleaned full_name (Individual, spec: organizations.name);
  - timezone = the user's timezone.
- memberships: role 1 Owner, status 1.
- deal_stages: 7 defaults (as nudge_create_default_stages).
- audit: user.register.
Then a 6-digit code is created and sent (Q-1). The cache keeps only an HMAC of it, for 10 minutes, with 5 tries. No table.
Rules:
- name: 2-80, a letter, no < >.
- type: "individual" or "business"; anything else (including capitalised values) -> VALIDATION_CHOICE_INVALID.
- company:
  - business: required, 2-120, no < > (VALIDATION_REQUIRED, VALIDATION_TOO_SHORT, VALIDATION_TOO_LONG, VALIDATION_MARKUP_NOT_ALLOWED).
  - individual: must be absent, null or empty; a non-empty value -> VALIDATION_COMPANY_NOT_ALLOWED.
- email: rules in BACKEND_PLAN section 6.
- password: 8-128 (Q-2) plus the rules in BACKEND_PLAN section 6.
- timezone: a valid IANA name.
Errors: 400 fields; 429.

### POST /auth/verify/ [midterm] (built, A4)
Public, CSRF required. Request: {"email", "code"} (exactly 6 digits).
200 {"access", "user": <Me>}. Sets nudge_refresh as a session cookie (no Max-Age); the session lasts 1 day.
- The user in the reply is the one just verified (`verified` is true); `organization` is the oldest active membership.
- Unknown fields -> 400 VALIDATION_UNKNOWN_FIELD; a malformed email or code -> 400 with `fields`.
Writes, in one transaction: users.email_verified_at, user_sessions (one row, the refresh value stored only as sha256), audit user.email_verify.
Errors:
- 400 AUTH_INVALID_CODE for a wrong, used, expired or unknown code or an unknown email: same status and body every time.
- 429 AUTH_CODE_ATTEMPTS_EXCEEDED once 5 wrong codes were tried for that email (also for an unknown email); Retry-After 30; a new code lifts it.
- 429 COMMON_RATE_LIMITED: more than 20 attempts per minute from one IP.
- 403 AUTH_CSRF_FAILED.

### POST /auth/resend/ [midterm] (built, A4)
Public, CSRF required. Request: {"email"}. 202 {"code": "AUTH_CODE_SENT", "detail": "..."} for every address.
A code is sent only to an existing, unverified account; the previous code stops working and the try counter resets. Nothing is sent to unknown or verified addresses.
Errors: 429 COMMON_RATE_LIMITED (1 per 30 s per email, counted for every address; 20 per minute per IP); 400 with `fields` for a bad email; 403 AUTH_CSRF_FAILED.

### POST /auth/login/ [midterm] (built, A5)
Public, CSRF required. Request: {"email", "password", "remember": bool}. remember is optional (missing or null = false); anything but true/false -> 400 fields.remember. The password is only checked for presence and 128 characters (old passwords still work).
200 {"access", "user": <Me>}. The access token lives 10 minutes (Q-9).
Sets nudge_refresh (Q-9):
- remember true: Max-Age 30 days, and user_sessions.expires_at = now + 30 days.
- remember false: a browser-session cookie (no Max-Age), and expires_at = now + 1 day.
Writes:
- user_sessions: refresh_token_hash = sha256 hex, device_name from User-Agent, ip_address, expires_at.
- users.last_login.
- audit: user.login (actor the user), or user.login_failed (actor_type 2, details {"email_hmac"}: a keyed hash, never the address or the password).
Errors:
- 400 fields.
- 401 AUTH_BAD_CREDENTIALS: same body for an unknown email, a wrong password or an inactive user.
- 403 AUTH_EMAIL_UNVERIFIED (Q-8). Returned only after the password is checked, so it does not reveal which emails exist. No session is created; the frontend sends the user to /verify and calls /auth/resend/.
- 429 COMMON_RATE_LIMITED: 5 attempts per minute per email (right or wrong) and 20 per minute per IP; Retry-After set; 503 when the cache is down (fails closed).

### POST /auth/refresh/ [midterm] (built, A5)
Cookie + CSRF. No body. 200 {"access", "user": <Me>}. Rotates nudge_refresh.
Writes: user_sessions.refresh_token_hash (replaced), last_used_at.
Errors:
- 401 AUTH_SESSION_INVALID when the cookie is missing, expired or revoked.
- 401 AUTH_SESSION_INVALID on reuse of an old refresh token (same code); the session is also revoked (revoked_at).
- 403 AUTH_CSRF_FAILED when the CSRF check fails.
- Every 401 here also clears the cookie (Max-Age 0).
- The session never gets longer: expires_at stays what login set. A 'keep me signed in' cookie gets Max-Age = the time the session has left.
- Two requests with the same cookie at once: one wins, the other ends the session (the frontend must send one refresh at a time).
- Audit: session.reuse_detected (actor the user, object the session).

### POST /auth/logout/ [midterm] (built, A5)
Cookie + CSRF. 204 always; clears the cookie. Only the session's current cookie value ends it; a missing, malformed or old value does nothing (still 204).
Writes: user_sessions.revoked_at; audit user.logout. The access token of that session stops working at once.

### GET /auth/me/ [midterm] (built, A5)
Bearer. The current organization is the oldest active membership until X-Organization-ID is added (A7).
<Me> = {
  "id", "name" (users.full_name), "email",
  "type" ("individual" | "business", from the current organization's account_type),
  "verified" (email_verified_at is not null),
  "phone", "timezone", "quiet_hours_start", "quiet_hours_end" ("HH:MM" or null),
  "organization": {"id", "name", "type", "timezone"}, "role" ("owner" | "admin" | "manager" | "member"),
  "organizations": [{"id", "name", "role"}]
}
Tables: users, memberships, organizations.
Errors: 401 (the frontend treats this as signed out).

### PATCH /auth/me/ [midterm] (built, A7)
Bearer. Only the fields that are sent change; an empty body changes nothing. null clears phone and both quiet-hours times. Audit details hold the field names only.
Quiet hours: after the change both are set or both are empty (VALIDATION_QUIET_HOURS_PAIR on the empty one). Times are "HH:MM" (VALIDATION_TIME_INVALID). Phone: "+" and a valid number, stored as E.164 (VALIDATION_PHONE_NEEDS_PLUS, VALIDATION_PHONE_INVALID). Unknown fields, including email, role and id -> 400 VALIDATION_UNKNOWN_FIELD.
GET /auth/me/ now honours X-Organization-ID for "organization" and "role" (unknown or foreign id -> 404) and returns quiet_hours_start and quiet_hours_end.
Request (all optional): {"name", "phone", "timezone", "quiet_hours_start", "quiet_hours_end"}.
200 <Me>. audit: user.profile_update.
Writes users.full_name, users.phone, users.timezone, users.quiet_hours_start, users.quiet_hours_end.
Rules:
- name: 2-80 after clean, a letter, no < > (Q-30).
- phone: international format with '+' and the country code, normalised to E.164 with phonenumbers; a number without '+' -> 400 (Q-12).
- timezone: a valid IANA name (zoneinfo).
- quiet hours: both set or both null.
Email cannot be changed here.
Errors: 400.

### POST /auth/password/ [midterm] (built, A6)
Bearer. Request: {"current", "password"}. 204.
Writes users.password (only if it is still the hash that was checked); revokes all other user_sessions of the user (this device stays signed in); audit user.password_change; the owner gets a "password was changed" email. The new password follows the sign-up rules, and may not equal the current one (VALIDATION_PASSWORD_SAME_AS_CURRENT).
Errors: 400 COMMON_VALIDATION_FAILED with fields.current = AUTH_WRONG_CURRENT_PASSWORD; with fields.password for the rules; 429 (bucket password_change_user).

### POST /auth/reset/ [midterm] (built, A6)
Public, CSRF required. Request: {"email"}. 202 {"code": "AUTH_RESET_LINK_SENT", "detail": "..."} always.
Sends a link to /new-password?token=<token>, valid 1 hour, single use. The token must match /^[\w-]{4,200}$/.
The token is '<user id hex>-<expiry>-<hmac>' (no email in it). Only an existing, active account gets a link; an unknown address gets the same 202 and nothing else (no email, no audit).
Tables: users (read). audit: user.password_reset_request (only when the user exists).
Errors: 429 (3 per hour per email, 10 per hour per IP).

### POST /auth/reset/confirm/ [midterm] (built, A6)
Public, CSRF required. Request: {"token", "password"}. 204.
Writes users.password (only if the hash the link was made for is still there); revokes all user_sessions; audit user.password_reset; the owner gets a "password was changed" email.
A link stops working when it is used, when the user signs in, when the password changes any other way, and after 1 hour. A reset does not verify an unverified email.
Errors: 400 AUTH_INVALID_TOKEN (wrong shape, wrong, used or expired: same body, no fields); 400 COMMON_VALIDATION_FAILED with fields.password (the link stays usable); 429 (10 per hour per IP).

### GET /auth/sessions/ [midterm]
200 [{"id", "device_name", "ip_address", "created_at", "last_used_at", "current": bool}].
Reads user_sessions of the caller WHERE revoked_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now(). Not paginated (one row per device).

### DELETE /auth/sessions/{id}/ [midterm]
204. Sets user_sessions.revoked_at. audit: session.revoke. 404 if the session is not the caller's.

### POST /auth/oauth/{google|microsoft}/start/ and GET /auth/oauth/{provider}/callback/ [later] (Q-3)
Not built for the midterm. The frontend hides the Google, Microsoft and SSO buttons in real mode. No table holds a provider subject id (G-A5), so the approach is decided later.

### Demo access (Q-4)
There is no demo endpoint and no bypass. `python manage.py seed_demo` (refuses to run when DEBUG is False, and in production settings) creates:
- a demo organization with the companies, contacts and deals from the frontend's seed.ts;
- a verified demo user with a random password, printed once.
That user signs in through POST /auth/login/ like anyone else.

## 3. accounts: organizations, members, teams, invitations

### GET /organizations/ [midterm]
200 [{"id", "name", "type", "role"}]. The workspace switcher.
Reads memberships (status 1) JOIN organizations (deactivated_at IS NULL).

### GET /organizations/current/ [midterm] (built, A7)
Header X-Organization-ID is required when the user has several organizations (400 TENANCY_ORGANIZATION_REQUIRED); an organization the user does not belong to is 404.
200 {"id", "name", "type", "timezone", "automation_paused": bool}.
Reads organizations (automation_paused_at, deactivated_at).

### PATCH /organizations/current/ [midterm] (built, A7)
Only the sent fields change (unknown fields such as currency or automation_paused -> 400). audit details: field names.
Owner or Admin. Request: {"name"? (2-120, no < >), "timezone"? (IANA)}. 200 as GET.
Writes organizations.name, organizations.timezone. audit: organization.update.
No currency field: the 'Default currency' select is removed from Workspace settings (Q-11). Errors: 400, 403.

### GET /members/ [midterm] (read-only; feeds owner selects and filters)
?status=active|suspended|removed (default active), ?q=.
200 page of {"id" (membership id), "user_id", "name", "email", "role", "status", "teams": [{"id", "name", "is_lead"}], "last_active_at"}.
Reads memberships, users, team_members, teams, user_sessions (max last_used_at). One query with prefetch.

### PATCH /members/{id}/ [later]
Owner or Admin. Request: {"role"?, "status"?}.
Writes memberships.role, memberships.status. audit: membership.role_change / membership.status_change.
Errors: 409 ACCOUNTS_LAST_OWNER when the change would leave no active Owner. Only an Owner may grant Owner.

### DELETE /members/{id}/ [later]
Sets memberships.status = 3 (rows are never deleted). Same 409.

### GET/POST /invitations/, POST /invitations/{id}/resend/, DELETE /invitations/{id}/ [later]
Request: {"email", "role", "team_id"?}.
Writes invitations: token_hash, expires_at = now + 7 days. Re-inviting the same email updates the pending row.
Errors: 409 ACCOUNTS_ALREADY_MEMBER when the email is already a member.

### POST /invitations/accept/ [later]
Public + token. Creates memberships, sets invitations.accepted_at.

### GET /teams/ [midterm] (read-only)
The spec marks teams and team_members as Midterm tables because visibility = team depends on them.
200 [{"id", "name", "members": [{"membership_id", "name", "is_lead"}]}], ordered by lower(name). Not paginated (one organization's teams).
Reads teams, team_members, memberships, users; two queries (teams + prefetch).
Members also see their own teams in GET /members/.
Midterm effect: the API cannot create teams, so visibility "team" only works with teams made by seed_demo (Sales, Support from the frontend seed).

### POST /teams/, PATCH/DELETE /teams/{id}/, POST/DELETE /teams/{id}/members/ [later]
Owner or Admin. Business organizations only (spec: 'departments inside a business organization').
Rules: name 1-80 after clean, unique per organization ignoring case (409 ACCOUNTS_TEAM_NAME_TAKEN); only Owner or Admin set is_lead.
Writes teams, team_members.
Errors: 409 ACCOUNTS_TEAM_IN_USE when deleting a team that still has Team-visible records (FK RESTRICT).

## 4. crm (midterm)

Visibility rule on every crm list and detail: Owner and Admin see all live rows. Others see visibility = organization, OR owner_id = me, OR (visibility = team AND team_id IN my teams).
Soft-deleted rows (deleted_at not null) behave as 404 (Q-15 covers restore).

### Deal stages

GET /deal-stages/ [midterm] (built, A7; all five deal-stage endpoints)
Any active member. All stage endpoints need the Bearer token and follow the X-Organization-ID rule above. A stage id of another organization is 404 COMMON_NOT_FOUND. Every write locks the organization's stage rows, runs in one transaction and writes an audit row (details: names, never secrets).
200 [{"id", "name", "position", "outcome": "open" | "won" | "lost", "deal_count"}] ordered by position. Not paginated (at most 12).
Reads deal_stages, deals (count of live deals).

POST /deal-stages/ [midterm]
Owner or Admin. Request: {"name"}. Inserted as an open stage before the won stage. 201.
Rules (Q-5): name 1-40 after clean, no < >, unique per organization ignoring case (uq_deal_stages_1); at most 12 stages in total.
Writes deal_stages. audit: deal_stage.create.
Errors: 400 (including CRM_STAGE_LIMIT_REACHED), 403, 409 CRM_STAGE_NAME_TAKEN. The 201 body is the new stage with deal_count 0; positions of Won and Lost move up by one.

PATCH /deal-stages/{id}/ [midterm]
Owner or Admin. Request: {"name"}. Writes deal_stages.name. audit: deal_stage.update.
Won and Lost stages cannot be renamed (Q-5): 400. Errors: 400, 403, 409 duplicate.

PUT /deal-stages/order/ [midterm]
Owner or Admin. Request: {"ids": [all stage ids in the new order]}. 200 list.
Rules (Q-5): the list must contain every stage exactly once; the first open stage stays first; open stages, then the one won stage, then the one lost stage last.
Positions are rewritten 0..n-1 in one transaction, unique and gap-free (spec). An order that is already current changes and audits nothing. A wrong list -> 400 fields.ids = CRM_STAGE_ORDER_INVALID; a missing or non-list ids -> VALIDATION_REQUIRED / VALIDATION_LIST_INVALID.
Writes deal_stages.position. audit: deal_stage.reorder. Errors: 400, 403.

DELETE /deal-stages/{id}/ [midterm]
Owner or Admin. 204. Only open stages; Won and Lost cannot be deleted (Q-5): 400 CRM_STAGE_FIXED. The remaining positions are closed up to 0..n-1.
Errors: 409 CRM_STAGE_IN_USE when any deal uses it (soft-deleted deals count, because the foreign key still blocks the delete); 409 CRM_LAST_OPEN_STAGE when it is the last open stage.

### Companies (built, 9 Nov 2026)

All company endpoints: Bearer token; X-Organization-ID rule as for stages; any active member; the visibility rule above decides which rows exist for the caller (others are 404). Unknown query parameters or body fields -> 400 naming them. Every write is audited and runs in one transaction.

GET /companies/ [midterm]
?q= (name, domain, industry; 2-100 characters; case-insensitive contains), ?owner_id=, ?ordering=name|-created_at (default name), ?page=, ?page_size= (1-100, default 25).
Response {"count", "next", "previous", "results": [<Company>]}; next/previous are absolute URLs or null. Always five queries.
Errors: 400 with the parameter named (VALIDATION_PAGE_INVALID, VALIDATION_PAGE_SIZE_INVALID, VALIDATION_CHOICE_INVALID, VALIDATION_TOO_SHORT/LONG, VALIDATION_UUID_INVALID, VALIDATION_UNKNOWN_FIELD).
<Company> = {
  "id", "name", "domain", "industry",
  "size_range": "1-10" | "11-50" | "51-200" | "201-500" | "500+" | null,
  "owner": {"id", "name"}, "visibility", "team_id",
  "people_count", "open_deal_count", "open_value": [{"currency", "amount"}],
  "created_at", "updated_at"
}
Reads companies (index ix_companies_2 for the name order), users (owner, select_related), contacts (count subquery), deals + deal_stages (one grouped query for the page: open count and sum per currency).

POST /companies/ [midterm]

Rules:
- name: 2-120, no < > (Q-30). Unique per organization ignoring case among live rows; a service check, since the DB has only an index (Q-16).
- domain: lowercase host name, <= 253, unique among live rows (uq_companies_1) (Q-16). A URL ('https://www.acme.com/path') is refused with VALIDATION_DOMAIN_INVALID. The spec would keep only the host; we keep our rule (BACKEND_PLAN section 6).
- visibility team: team_id must be a team of the organization that the caller belongs to (spec).
- industry: <= 80.
- owner: an active member.
- team_id: required if and only if visibility = team (ck_companies_visibility_team_id).

## 9. Rate limits (token bucket, ARCHITECTURE 8)

Midterm implementation (9 Nov 2026): a fixed-window counter in the shared cache with the same limits as the policies below (capacity = attempts per window). It answers the same 429 COMMON_RATE_LIMITED with Retry-After, fails closed (503 when the cache is down), and sends no X-RateLimit-* headers. The token bucket with the Redis Lua script is postponed. Policies in use: register_ip, verify_ip (also used by resend), resend_email (also counted by register, for every address).

Each policy is a bucket with capacity C (burst) and refill R tokens per second, keyed by IP, user id or the HMAC of the normalised email. Cost is 1 per request.
- Redis with one atomic Lua script per check. The script reads time from Redis TIME, so app servers with skewed clocks cannot disagree. The in-memory store (dev, one process) uses the injected app clock.
- 429 COMMON_RATE_LIMITED with Retry-After = ceil((cost - tokens) / R). X-RateLimit-Limit and X-RateLimit-Remaining on every limited endpoint.
- Policies live in common/constants.py.

Store failure (Redis down or erroring):
- critical policies fail closed: 503 COMMON_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE;
- other policies fail open: the request goes through without rate-limit headers, and a warning is logged with the policy name (never the key).

| Policy | Key | C | R (per second) | Critical | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| login_email | email HMAC | 5 | 5/60 (0.0833) | yes | ARCHITECTURE |
| login_ip | IP | 20 | 20/60 (0.333) | yes | ARCHITECTURE |
| resend_email | email HMAC | 1 | 1/30 (0.0333) | yes | ARCHITECTURE (Q-1) |
| api_user | user id | 120 | 120/60 (2.0) | no | ARCHITECTURE (every authenticated endpoint) |
| verify_ip | IP | 20 | 20/60 (0.333) | yes | proposal, needs your OK |
| register_ip | IP | 10 | 10/3600 (0.00278) | yes | proposal, needs your OK |
| reset_email | email HMAC | 3 | 3/3600 (0.000833) | yes | proposal, needs your OK |
| reset_ip | IP | 10 | 10/3600 (0.00278) | yes | proposal, needs your OK |
| reset_confirm_ip | IP | 10 | 10/3600 (0.00278) | yes | proposal, needs your OK |
| password_change_user | user id | 5 | 5/900 (0.00556) | yes (proposed; it guards current-password guessing) | proposal, needs your OK |

Verify '5 tries per code' is not a bucket. It is a try counter stored with the code: 429 AUTH_CODE_ATTEMPTS_EXCEEDED on the 6th try.
